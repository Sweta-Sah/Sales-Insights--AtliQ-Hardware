## Problem Statement
AtliHardware is a company that supplies complex hardware and peripherals to many of its clients. So the sales director of this company is facing many challenges:

- The market is growing dynamically, and he is facing issues in terms of tracking sales.

- Issue with insights into his business, the overall sales are declining but the regional managers are not giving the proper insights into the sales.

- Dozens of data.

- In need of data-driven decisions.

## Learnings:
Through this project, I gained valuable skills in several areas, including

- working with the AIMS grid

- performing ETL operations

- cleaning and normalizing data

- using DAX language to create custom visualizations

I also learned about how data analysis projects are executed in big companies, which was an eye-opening experience.

### AIMS Grid:
It is a project management tool. It has four interdependent components-
1)Purpose
2)Stake Holder(People Involved)
3)End result
4)Success criteria

The final product is an interactive dashboard that effectively displays the sales trend of AtliQ hardware, allowing users to easily understand the data and make informed, data-driven decisions. I'm confident that this dashboard has the potential to increase the company's sales and revenue in the next quarter.
